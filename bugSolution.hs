The solution involves handling the infinite list more carefully and only processing a finite portion. We can use `take` to limit the number of elements processed or use a different approach altogether. This example uses `take` to sum the first 10 elements:

```haskell
myFunction :: [Int] -> Int
myFunction xs = sum (take 10 xs)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = myFunction [1..]
  print result
```

Alternatively, if the intention is to handle potentially infinite lists, you might use a more sophisticated approach such as folding or recursion with a termination condition based on input properties other than the list length.
