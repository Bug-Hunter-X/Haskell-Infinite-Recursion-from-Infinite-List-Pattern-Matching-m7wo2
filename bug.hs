This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on an infinite list, which will not terminate.  The pattern match `(x:xs)` expects a list with at least one element.  Since `[1..]` is an infinite list, the pattern match will never find the end of the list, leading to infinite recursion.

```haskell
myFunction :: [Int] -> Int
myFunction (x:xs) = x + sum xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = myFunction [1..]
  print result
```
